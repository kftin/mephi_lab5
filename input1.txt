The shoe has asexual and sexual reproduction (sexual process).
Asexual reproduction - transverse division in the active state. 
It is accompanied by complex regeneration processes.
For example, one of the individuals re-forms a cellular mouth with a perioral cilia,
each completes the missing contractile vacuole, the basal bodies multiply and new cilia are formed, etc.
The sexual process, like that of other ciliates, occurs in the form of conjugation.
Shoes belonging to different clones are temporarily "glued" by their mouth sides,
and a cytoplasmic bridge is formed between the cells.
Then the macronuclei of the conjugating ciliates are destroyed, 
and the micronuclei are divided by meiosis. Of the four haploid nuclei formed,
three die, and the remaining one divides by mitosis.
Each ciliate now has two haploid pronuclei - one is female (stationary) and the other is male (migratory).
Ciliates exchange male pronuclei, while females remain in "their" cell. 
Then, in each ciliate, "own" female and "alien" male pronuclei merge, forming a diploid nucleus - a synkaryon.
When the synkaryon divides, two nuclei are formed.
One of them becomes a diploid micronucleus, and the second turns into a polyploid macronucleus.
In reality, this process is more complicated and is accompanied by special post-conjugation divisions.
